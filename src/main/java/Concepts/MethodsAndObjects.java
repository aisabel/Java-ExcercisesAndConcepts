        * A method can only return one value
        * Methods contain return types ('void'), but also can contain int, string, etc.
        * Return typeâ†’ int indicates the data type value that will be returned back to the code that calls it (int in this case)
        * No methods are allowed inside the main block
        *
    * Objects are instances of a class. Call the methods with the help of objects.
    * Its also called an instance of a class
        * Objects need to allocate memory.
        * Memory can be allocated with the help of 'new' operator and provide class name.
        * Syntax: Return class name -> Object name = new operator ->class name
        * Call the method with the object with syntax: objectName.methodName();
